Flow of the application: 

Sensor is moved around - and wherever the VOC spikes above a given threshold value - The sensor beeps and the user is prompted to take a photograph(s). [1]
The photo is uploaded on the server. 
The value of the VOC content from the server is also sent to the server 
Both the photo and label (VOC content) are added to a separate database -- This will be the database that our model will be trained on.
If this is the Naive User activity of the Android App then: 
The App will now ask the user the following things 
How many windows does this room have ? [2] (n)
Is there a source of mechanical ventilation in the room ? If yes, Specify how many. (m)
These responses will be sent to the server 
Weather API calls will be made to obtain wind speed and wind direction (w,d)
All these will be used to output a list of recommendations (Python program that will run on the server along with the model inference - Algorithm specified below)
These recommendations + Label of the image will be sent to the Android App and displayed in the form of a report.
 b. The Server will also run the inference on the image that has been uploaded and       that will be returned as the label.     
 


Recommender System: 

Since the object recommender is not a usable option (the lack of an appropriate dataset) - We can use the following naive recommender: 

Let the number of windows be = n 
Let the percentage of sunlight in a room be = s (in percent)
Let the VOC content recorded by the sensor be = v 
Let the source(s) of mechanical ventilation in the room be =  m
Let the Wind speed be = w (km/h)
Let the Wind direction be = d (degrees)
Let the age of the article = a (years)

Data Structure : Decision Tree 

Algo:
recommend(char ch)

	{
		check n; 
		if(n!=0):  //if the rooms has some windows that can be used for natural ventilation	
		{
			check if(w*d > air_dispersion_threshold_value) 
{
/*only when the air dispersion  (w*d) outside is high enough, should we suggest natural ventilation, otherwise, the outside Air Quality + VOC content could negatively affect the VOC conc inside the house (eg: for a user in New Delhi) */

	if (v  > 50)
		t = 30 minutes;  //t = how many minutes the user should allow ventilation
	if( v > 100)
		t = 60 minutes;
	...
  
	cout<<”Open the windows for”<<t<<”minutes”;

	//(w*d) is too low or if there are no windows 
	if(m ==1 )
		t = 60 minutes;
	if(m ==2)
		t= 30 minutes;
	…
	cout<<”Use mechanical ventilation for<<”t<<”minutes”;

	//Will add recommendations according to https://blog.paleohacks.com/toxins-in-furniture/

if (v>threshold_value age<1 year): // high VOC content with new items 
	recommend(a)

Metric 
The object detection challenge is, at the same time, a regression and a classification task. First of all, to assess the spatial precision we need to remove the boxes with low confidence (usually, the model outputs many more boxes than actual objects). Then, we use the Intersection over Union (IoU) area, a value between 0 and 1. It corresponds to the overlapping area between the predicted box and the ground-truth box. The higher the IoU, the better the predicted location of the box for a given object. Usually, we keep all bounding box candidates with an IoU greater than some threshold.
